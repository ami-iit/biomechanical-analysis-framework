# biomechanical-analysis-framework

The biomechanical-analysis-framework projects contains a set of C++ libraries that can be used to estimate a human kinematics and dynamics quantities.

## Dependencies

The dependencies can be installed in two ways; the first one is via `conda` creating a conda environment running the following steps.
 
* Clone the repo:

   ```
   git clone https://github.com/ami-iit/biomechanical-analysis-framework
   ```
* Create the conda environment from file to automatically install dependencies:
  ```
   cd biomechanical-analysis-framework
   conda env create -n <conda-environment-name> --file ci_env.yml
   ```
* Note: if you are already inside an existing conda environment, you can type instead:
  ```
   cd biomechanical-analysis-framework
   conda env update --file ci_env.yml
   ```

  
The second option is to install the dependencies via [robotology-superbuild](https://github.com/robotology/robotology-superbuild/blob/master/README.md), making sure to enable the following CMake options:
   - `ROBOTOLOGY_ENABLE_DYNAMICS`;
   - `ROBOTOLOGY_ENABLE_DYNAMICS_FULL_DEPS`;
   - `ROBOTOLOGY_ENABLE_ICUB_HEAD`;

## Install

Clone the repo (if not already done to install the dependencies) and create a `build` directory

```
git clone https://github.com/ami-iit/biomechanical-analysis-framework
cd biomechanical-analysis-framework
mkdir build
cd build
```

### Linux/macOS

From the build directory, configure the CMake project and install it in the `build/install` directory:

```bash

cmake -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE="Release" -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX="./install" ..
make
make install
```

Once the installation is completed, append the following lines to your `.bashrc`:
```bash
BAF_INSTALL_DIR=<directory-where-you-downloaded-component_ifeel>element_wearable_sw/build/install
export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=$LD_LIBRARY_PATH:${BAF_INSTALL_DIR}/lib
export CMAKE_PREFIX_PATH=$CMAKE_PREFIX_PATH:${BAF_INSTALL_DIR}
```

>:warning: If on macOS, replace LD_LIBRARY_PATH with DYLD_LIBRARY_PATH in your `.bash_profile`


### Windows

From the build directory, configure the CMake project and install it in the `build/install` directory as it follows:

```bash
cmake -G"Visual Studio 17 2022" .. 
cmake -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE="Release" -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX="./install" .
cmake --build . --config Release --target INSTALL
```

>:warning: Change Visual Studio 17 2022 according to your installed version.

Once the installation is completed, update the following environment variables:

- `PATH`  
Add `<directory-where-you-downloaded-BAF>/build/install/bin`


## KPI Computation

This repository also contains Python code for KPI computation located in the `KPI` folder. For detailed instructions on how to install and use the Python package, please refer to the [`README`](https://github.com/ami-iit/biomechanical-analysis-framework/tree/add-KPI/KPI/README.md) in the `KPI` directory.
